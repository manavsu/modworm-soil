add a ping feature to check on startup if the server is available
drop down menus that fade everything in the back
use ping feature to figure out if ports are open for use by simulators
auto network mapping
read blocks
better message tabs -> add a game like thing on the right side of the scrren that stay show error messages.

When sockets and network maps are store, ping every socket to see if its still online make it red if not
use scapy instead of nmap

Create my own modbus library which would be as simple as using an array
